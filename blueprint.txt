It should also have links to the store's social media pages and a newsletter subscription form.

11. Charts:
The charts section should display the store's sales data, including the number of artworks sold, revenue, and popular categories. It should also have a graph displaying the store's growth over time.

12. Buttons:
The buttons should be consistent throughout the UI and should have a clear call-to-action. The "Buy Now" button should be prominent and easily accessible. The "Add to Cart" button should be visible on the artwork details page. The "Checkout" button should be visible on the cart page. The "Place Order" button should be visible on the checkout page.
